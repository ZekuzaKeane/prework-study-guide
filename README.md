# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

One of, if not THE most difficult things when it comes to learning web development is keeping track of all of the information, especially when you're just starting out. I built this website to keep track of my notes, practice practical implementations, and have a little fun with it all.

It's a pretty simple web page, but I hope it comes in handy for students who may be struggling with all of the topics introduced before we even start classes. Good luck to you guys!

I pretty much started this project learning from the ground up. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.
